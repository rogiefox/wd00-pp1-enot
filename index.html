                    <p>Surigao city is also known as the city of island adventure, because of the clear and clean seas and high waves that will make your mind to think about tsunami but it’s just normal waves, but Surigao is not just know of their water adventure but instead they are more productive In terms of festivals, festivals are the thing that our ancient ancestors give us and now we still recognize the value of different festivals as well as the sources and histories. In Surigao city one of the festivals that truly appreciate the God given blessings of their city, is the “kinilaw (raw fish delicacy) festival held one very 2nd week of September at the center of Surigao city respectably. </p>

                    <p>Sayongsong is a traditional Filipino steamed rice cake from Surigao del Norte and other areas of the Caraga Region of northeastern Mindanao, as well as the southeastern Visayas (Bohol, Samar, Leyte) where it is known as sarungsong or alisuso.

                    <p>Mabua Pebble Beach, which is located near Surigao's city center, stands out from other Philippine beaches thanks to the abundance of fine, white pebbles that make up its beachfront. Mabua Pebble Beach is made up of an infinite number of smooth pebbles, each with a unique size and form.
                    Towards the water, on the right, is a rock formation. It is simple to ascend the rocks but exercise additional caution because some of the rocks have slick edges. The stones are exceptionally white here, especially in the summer, and the waters are crystal pure. Because certain areas on our feet are related to our internal organs, strolling barefoot on smooth stones has an effect on the body, making this beach both beautiful and restorative.</p>

                    <h1 class="sub-title1">Wooden Bridge</h1>
                    <p>San Pedro Bridge is dubbed as the longest wooden foot bridge in the Philippines which connects to island barangays, Brgy. Cantiasay and  Brgy. San Pedro formerly known as Brgy. Hanigad  . It is one of the main attractions in Surigao City specifically in Nonoc Island. This old photo that I have shows the longevity and the capacity of the bridge to cope with time. If you want to visit here, you can have four options upon crossing the sea for at least almost an hour from Surigao City via motor boat . You can have your point of transportation from Brgy. Talisay, Brgy. Nonoc and the nearest point are directly in Brgy. Cantiasay and Brgy. San Pedro.</p>

                    <p>Silop Cave Complex (SCC) is in Barangay Silop, Surigao City, Surigao del Norte - Of particular interest is Cave 4a which is part of the established 16 other entrances. It is the only water cave in the system where freshwater runs through the cave at an average depth of 5 feet in the dry season. Certain lengths are as deep as 8 feet. Source pool is 20 feet deep or deeper. The cave is estimated to be 1,000 meters long to reach the source pool. As of today, there is no baseline information for which the LGU can use as basis to start protecting the area. Today cave 4A’s waters remain an enigma as to its contents, composition and importance to the surrounding forest. Since 2011, the FCD members have spent personal finances to investigate the nature of the SUCS to find out about the value of protecting the area against urbanization.</p>
